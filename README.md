# Terraform Deployment for ECS Cluster

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying an ECS cluster along with associated resources like ECR, RDS, and IAM roles.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI. Follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
2. **Terraform**: Install Terraform. Follow the [Terraform installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

## AWS Configuration

Before you begin, configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format (e.g., json).

## Terraform Setup

Navigate to the Terraform directory where your configuration files are located. This example assumes your configuration files are located in `terraform/deploy-ecs-cluster/organization/application/staging/`.

```bash
cd terraform/deploy-ecs-cluster/organization/application/staging/
```

## Adjust Placeholders and Variables

Before initializing Terraform, ensure all placeholders and variables are properly set in `main.tf` and `variables.tf`.

### Example Placeholders:

- `<ECS_CLUSTER_NAME>`
- `<CREATED_BY>`
- `<ORGANISATION>`
- `<ENVIRONMENT>`
- `<REPOSITORY_NAME>`
- `<CONTAINER_CPU>`
- `<CONTAINER_MEMORY>`
- `<CONTAINER_PORT>`
- `<HOST_PORT>`
- `<DB_IDENTIFIER>`
- `<DB_NAME>`
- `<DB_INSTANCE_CLASS>`
- `<DB_PASSWORD>`
- `<VPC_ID>`
- `<SERVICE_ROLE_CODEDEPLOY>`
- `<MIN_SCALE>`
- `<MAX_SCALE>`
- `<AUTO_SCALE_ROLE>`
- `<EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN>`
- `<TASK_ROLE_ARN>`
- `<AWS_REGION>`

Ensure these are replaced with appropriate values in your `main.tf` and `variables.tf`.

## Terraform Commands

Initialize the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
```

Generate and review an execution plan:

```bash
terraform plan -out plan.out
```

Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply "plan.out"
```

## Additional Information

- Make sure to review the Terraform plan output carefully before applying.
- Adjust the security group rules as per your security requirements.
- Ensure that the IAM roles and policies are properly configured to allow the necessary actions.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the infrastructure managed by Terraform, use:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
